UTILITY SERVICE PROVIDER:
Assume that a number of independent utility service providers are allowed to market and sell utility products
atcompetitive prices to residential customers. Each provider offers all of the products listed below, but consumers
are allowed to choose different types of utility services from different providers. Following is a list of utility
services:
• Natural Gas
• Internet Service
o TV
o Mobile Phone
o Home Phone
• Hydro
o Electric
o Water
o Sewerage
Create a system that maintains all the necessary information about the utilities, customers, income/sales from
utility services, billing (paid / default), etc. For the sake of simplicity, you can assume the following:
• Number of providers = 10
• Number of Customers = 100
• Total Time for record = 6 months
• Payment overdue time = more than 30 days after bill
You can search and find rates for any of these types of utilities. Make sure that billing also includes the fixed
components, i.e., meter rate for all types of above-mentioned utilities
